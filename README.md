To obtain more appropriate control filters for differen primary noises, a generative fixed-filter active noise control (GFANC) approach is proposed in this paper. Specifically, various control filters can be generated by using different hard weights to combine sub control filters. The hard weights are automatically obtained via a one-dimensional convolutional neural network given the incoming noise.

we have provided the trained 1D CNN model, you can easily run the "Noise_Cancellation_GFANC.ipynb" file to get the noise reduction results. The real noises in our experiemnts are provided in "Real Noise Examples".
