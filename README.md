# Generative-Fixed-filter-Active-Noise-Control-based-on-Deep-Learning

Descriptionï¼š This is the code of paper "Generative Fixed filter Active Noise Control based on Deep Learning". Thanks for your supports.

To overcome the limitation and obtain more appropriate control filters, a generative fixed-filter active noise control (GFANC) approach is proposed in this paper. Specifically, various control filters can be generated by using different hard weights to combine pre-trained sub control filters. The hard weights are automatically obtained via a one-dimensional convolutional neural network given the incoming noise.

If you want to train the network, you can run the ".ipynb" files in the three folders in order. 
we have provided the trained 1D CNN model, you can easily run the "Noise_Cancellation_GFANC.ipynb" file in "3.Noise_Cancellation_Code" to get the noise reduction results. The real noises in our experiemnts are provided in "Real Noise Examples".
