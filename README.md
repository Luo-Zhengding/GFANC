To obtain more appropriate control filters for differen primary noises, a generative fixed-filter active noise control (GFANC) approach is proposed in this paper. Specifically, various control filters can be generated by using different hard weights to combine sub control filters. The hard weights are automatically obtained via a one-dimensional convolutional neural network given the incoming noise.

If you want to re-train the network, you can run the ".ipynb" files in the three folders in order. 
we have provided the trained 1D CNN model, you can easily run the "Noise_Cancellation_GFANC.ipynb" file in "3.Noise_Cancellation_Code" to get the noise reduction results. The real noises in our experiemnts are provided in "Real Noise Examples".
